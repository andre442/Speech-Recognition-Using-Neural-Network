Speech recognition using neural network MATLAB

This repository tries to produce an algorithm in order to distinguish 2 different speakers through samples of audio emitted in a fixed frequency by different people.

The file "network_x2" is the neural network trained with the audio samples that I used. Just replace it with another neural network with the samples of your voice that you will use.

The code has some errors and needs to be improved.
